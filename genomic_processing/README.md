### Genomic Processing

Genomic processing involves the reading and writing of genomic data files (here in the format of FASTQ). Then, implemented algorithms are used to analyze and manipulate the DNA,
RNA, and protein sequences as read from the FASTQ inputs. This involves aligning sequence reads to reference genomes, identifying genetic variants like SNPs, and optimizations like parallelism and concurrency.
